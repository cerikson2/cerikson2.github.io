		Survivor Stories
			Seeing the parade of motorcycles from all over the United States was super exciting.  
			They brought pins and patches from all over the United States and put them on a sash to decorate my wheelchair. 
			After so many days of pain and boredom, seeing the Cycle Out Cancer riders was a real thrill!  ~ Jennifer
			
			I spent 10 days in the hospital just crying.  The Cycle Out Cancer guys were so colorful
			and generous.  They gave the hospital a very generous donation in my name and showed me
			that even strangers care about me. ~ Kristen
			
			I had the good fortune to meet several Cycle Out Cancer guys. Everyone has been touched 
			by cancer.  They are out there doing something about it. ~ Fritz
			
			As soon as my treatments are over, I'm getting a Spyder motorcycle to ride with Cycle Out Cancer.
			Can't wait! ~ Scott

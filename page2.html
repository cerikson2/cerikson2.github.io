<body>
    <p>My name is Charles (Charlie) Erikson. I was named after my grandfather. 
I was born and raised in Janesville, Wisconsin. My academic career has all gone through the Janesville School District. 
I was enrolled in Jefferson Elementary, Marshall Middle School, and Craig High School. 


I have little work/volunteer experience. I have helped my family members move, worked on a farm, and grown/cared for plants. 
I played basketball for Marshall Middle School, Craig High School, and Saint Paulâ€™s church.</p>
